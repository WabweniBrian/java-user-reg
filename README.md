# User Registration

This project is a simple user registration system implemented in Java. It consists of two classes: `User` and `Main`.

## Operations

The user registration system provides the following operations:

- `getUsers`: Retrieves all registered users.
- `getUserById`: Retrieves a user by their ID.
- `deleteUser`: Deletes a user from the system.
- `exit`: Exits the user registration system.

To perform these operations, you can refer to the `Main` class in the code.
